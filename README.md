# HPO to SNOMED Mapping Pipeline

This project implements a pipeline to translate disease‚Äìphenotype associations into disease‚ÄìSNOMED CT concept associations. It integrates:

‚úÖ Official cross-references from HPO to SNOMED CT  
‚úÖ Semantic mappings using SapBERT embeddings for HPO terms without direct SNOMED mappings  

The result is a rich mapping between diseases, phenotypes, and SNOMED concepts for downstream analyses such as knowledge graph building, data integration, and clinical analytics.

## üî¨ Use Cases
- Integrate HPO's phenotypes and diseases into SNOMED using SapBERT embedding semantic search

## üìÇ Pipeline Steps

### 1. Load Data

- Load the HPO ontology (`hp.obo`) as a graph
- Load HPO association files:
  - `phenotype.hpoa` ‚Äî disease‚Äìphenotype associations
  - `phenotype_to_genes.txt` ‚Äî phenotype ‚Üí gene ‚Üí disease mappings
  - `genes_to_phenotype.txt` ‚Äî disease ‚Üí gene ‚Üí phenotype mappings
- Load SNOMED CT data:
  - SNOMED concepts and terms
  - SNOMED semantic tags, e.g. top categories such as ‚Äúfinding‚Äù

---

### 2. Process HPO Concepts

- Extract HPO concepts from the ontology:
  - IDs, labels, definitions, synonyms, xrefs
- Split concepts into:
  - **Mappable:** concepts with official SNOMED xrefs
  - **Non-mappable:** concepts without SNOMED xrefs

---

### 3. Official Mappings

- For mappable HPO concepts:
  - Extract SNOMED IDs from xrefs
  - Join with SNOMED concept terms for official mappings

---

### 4. Semantic Mappings (SapBERT)

- For non-mappable HPO concepts:
  - Encode HPO labels/synonyms with SapBERT
  - Encode SNOMED terms with SapBERT
  - Compute cosine similarity
  - Keep mappings above a similarity threshold

---

### 5. Disease Name Mapping

- Map disease names from `phenotype.hpoa` to SNOMED CT using SapBERT embeddings

---

### 6. Create Association Mappings

- Combine official and semantic mappings into a unified HPO ‚Üí SNOMED mapping table
- Build gene‚Äìphenotype‚Äìdisease associations:
  - Map phenotype ‚Üí gene connections onto SNOMED
  - Map gene ‚Üí phenotype connections onto SNOMED

---

### 7. Save Outputs

Outputs are saved as Parquet files in the `output_mapping/` folder:

1. HPO diseases and phenotype mappings:  
   - `all_pheno_hpo_snomed_mapping.parquet` ‚Äî full mapping of HPO phenotype ‚Üí SNOMED concepts
   - `all_disease_hpo_snomed_mapping.parquet` ‚Äî full mapping of HPO disease ‚Üí SNOMED concepts

2. disease gene phenotype association, where disease and phenotype are mapped to SNOMED, only the maping with top 1 score >= 0.8 are kept:
   - `pheno_to_gene_snomed_mapping.parquet` ‚Äî phenotype, gene and diseases associations in SNOMED space
   - `gene_to_pheno_snomed_mapping.parquet` ‚Äî  phenotype, gene and diseases associations in SNOMED space
